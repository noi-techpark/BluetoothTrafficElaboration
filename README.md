# BluetoothTrafficElaboration

[![ci BluetoothTrafficElaboration](https://github.com/noi-techpark/BluetoothTrafficElaboration/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/noi-techpark/BluetoothTrafficElaboration/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

Application which takes vehicular traffic data from the big data platform, collected by bluetoothboxes around the city of Bolzano, 
and makes different elaborations and saving them back to the bdp again.

## Getting started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running
on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

To build the project, the following prerequisites must be met:

- Java JDK 1.8 or higher (e.g. [OpenJDK](https://openjdk.java.net/))
- [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) 3.x
- A postgres database with the schema intimev2 and elaboration (bdp) already installed

### Source code

Get a copy of the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/noi-techpark/BluetoothTrafficElaboration
```

Change directory:

```bash
cd BluetoothTrafficElaboration/
```

### Build

Build the project:

```bash
mvn clean package
```

## Running tests

The unit tests can be executed with the following command:

```bash
mvn clean test
```

## Deployment

This is a maven project and will produce a war that can be deployed in any j2ee container like tomcat or jetty.

Steps:

* connect to the postgres database and execute the following script that will add the intimev2.deltart function
  to an existing bdp database
  
```bash
psql ... < BluetoothTrafficElaboration/deltart.sql
```

* change the file src/main/resources/app.properties. set the variable jdbc.connectionString with the jdbc url that connect to the postgres
  database (or configure it within a CI tool)
  
```
jdbc.connectionString=jdbc:postgresql://host:port/db?user=...
```

* create the war executing the following command

```
mvn clean package
```

* deploy the bluetoothtrafficelaboration.war to a j2ee container like tomcat or jetty

* open the (simple) dashboard to check if the project is started/working

```
http(s)://host:port/bluetoothtrafficelaboration
```

### Configure Elaborations/Tasks

Elaborations can be configured in table **scheduler_task**.

Required columns:

**application_name**: 'vtraffic/plugin\_cs\_monitor'  
**task_name**       : descriptive name of the task for human  
**function_name**   : the function used for the elaboration. valid values are listed below  
**args**            : period/window of the elaboration in seconds (600 = 10min)  
**calc_order**      : if null elaboration is skipped. If a number it is used to order elaborations sequentially (order is important because elaborations may have dependencies)  
**enabled**         : 'T'  
**status**          : 'QUEUED'  

valid function_name values are:

compute\_bspeed  
compute\_bspeed\_100kmh  
count\_bluetooth\_intime  
count\_match\_intime  
create\_bluetooth\_lhv  
create\_matches  
run\_mode\_intime  
run\_mode\_intime\_100kmh  

Here an example sql statement on how to add a new elaboration (please modify values before execution):

```
insert into scheduler_task (application_name,             task_name,          function_name,            args, calc_order, enabled, status)
                    values ('vtraffic/plugin_cs_monitor', 'descriptive name', 'count_bluetooth_intime',   60,          1, 'T',     'QUEUED');
                    
insert into scheduler_task (application_name,             task_name,          function_name,            args, calc_order, enabled, status)
                    values ('vtraffic/plugin_cs_monitor', 'Bluetooth Elapsed time greater than 100 km/h', 'run_mode_intime_100kmh',   600,       99998, 'T',     'QUEUED');

insert into scheduler_task (application_name,             task_name,          function_name,            args, calc_order, enabled, status)
                    values ('vtraffic/plugin_cs_monitor', 'speed greater than 100 km/h', 'compute_bspeed_100kmh',   600,       99999, 'T',     'QUEUED');
                    

```
